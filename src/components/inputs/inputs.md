All of the inputs that can validate through `ValourForm`. 

Inputs and Icons receive their styles and other functionality from [es-components](https://github.com/TWExchangeSolutions/es-components).
The functionality from es-components (isDisabled, inline, etc.) is still usable in the valoured versions. However, some conflicts with the es-components onChange/onBlur handlers may occur when using the valoured version's `validateOnChange`/`validateOnBlur` props.
